              A Front-End Web Developer with a Passion for Problem Solving.
            </h5>
            <h6 class="card-subtitle text-muted p-3">
              After completing my associate's degree in pre-nursing, I realized
              that medicine wasn't for me and decided to give coding a shot. I
              chose coding because I have always had an interest in technology,
              yet I knew nothing about code, and that intrigued me. I was
              successful in teaching myself how to code using online resources
              and creating personal projects. As soon as I made a
              rock-paper-scissors game using JavaScript, I knew that I developed
              a passion for web development. I would say that I am a highly
              disciplined and persistent person. Those two traits have been
              integral to my success as a self-taught developer, as I had to
              wrap my head around very difficult concepts every day. I enjoy
              learning and I am always browsing the web looking for new
              technologies that could make me a stronger developer.
              <br />
              <br />
              My problem solving skills are something that I am really proud of,
              and have allowed me to make many exciting projects. Coding things
              like a calculator, a todo list, or a tic-tac-toe game seemed like
              they would be simple, but they really put my ability to solve
              problems to the test! Fortunately, I have been able to develop
              those skills not only through learning how to code, but also
              through 4+ years training martial arts. Throughout those four
              years, I had always found it extremely helpful to break down a big
              problem into smaller ones, and go from there. That strategy has
              also proven itself to be extremely effective while coding. The one
              thing I really want to drive home about me is that I am a driven
              and hardworking individual, and I am committed to delivering
              exceptional results in everything I do. I would love to bring my
              skills and passion for web development to your team.

                This is a simple HTML and CSS project that showcases a
                restaurant website called Fresno's Cafe. The website has a clean
                and modern design, with a responsive layout that adjusts to
                different screen sizes. The website features a header with the
                restaurant's logo and navigation links to different pages. The
                main section of the website showcases some of the restaurant's
                best food and drinks. This section is meant to highlight the
                restaurant's menu and entice visitors to try out their
                offerings. The website also has a call-to-action section that
                encourages visitors to visit the restaurant and experience its
                food and drinks. This section features a button that links to
                the menu page. Finally, the website has a footer that displays
                the restaurant's copyright information.
