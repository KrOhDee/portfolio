              A Front-End Web Developer with a Passion for Problem Solving.
            </h5>
            <h6 class="card-subtitle text-muted p-3">
              I decided to pursue coding because I have always had an interest
              in technology, yet I knew nothing about code, and that intrigued
              me. I wanted to know how the technologies I was around everyday
              worked, and so I learned. I have created numerous projects with
              various front-end technologies. I would say that when I built a
              rock-paper-scissors game using JavaScript, I knew that I developed
              a passion for web development. I am a highly disciplined and
              persistent person. Those two traits have been integral to my
              success as a developer, as I have had to wrap my head around very
              difficult concepts every day. I enjoy learning and I am always
              browsing the web looking for ways that I could improve as a
              developer.
              <br />
              <br />
              My problem solving skills are something that I am really proud of,
              and have allowed me to make many exciting projects. Coding things
              like a calculator, a todo list, or a tic-tac-toe game seemed like
              they would be trivial at first, but they really put my ability to
              solve problems to the test! Fortunately, I have been able to
              develop those skills not only through learning how to code, but
              also through 4+ years training martial arts. Throughout those four
              years, I had always found it extremely helpful to break down a big
              problem into smaller ones, and go from there. That strategy has
              also proven itself to be extremely effective while coding. The one
              thing I really want to drive home about me is that I am a driven
              and hardworking individual, and I am committed to delivering
              exceptional results in everything I do. I would love to bring my
              skills and passion for web development to your team.

                This is a simple HTML and CSS project that showcases a
                restaurant website called Fresno's Cafe. The website has a clean
                and modern design, with a responsive layout that adjusts to
                different screen sizes. The website features a header with the
                restaurant's logo and navigation links to different pages. The
                main section of the website showcases some of the restaurant's
                best food and drinks. This section is meant to highlight the
                restaurant's menu and entice visitors to try out their
                offerings. The website also has a call-to-action section that
                encourages visitors to visit the restaurant and experience its
                food and drinks. This section features a button that links to
                the menu page. Finally, the website has a footer that displays
                the restaurant's copyright information.
