              A Self-Taught Front-End Web Developer with a Passion for Problem
              Solving.
            </h5>
            <h6 class="card-subtitle text-muted p-3">
              After completing my associate's degree in pre-nursing, I realized
              that medicine wasn't for me and decided to give coding a shot. I
              chose coding because I have always had an interest in technology,
              yet I knew nothing about code and that intrigued me. I was
              successful in teaching myself how to code using online resources
              and creating personal projects. As soon as I made a
              rock-paper-scissors game using JavaScript, I knew that I developed
              a passion for web development. I would say that I am a highly
              disciplined and persistent person. Those two traits have been
              integral to my success as a self-taught developer, as I had to
              wrap my head around very difficult concepts every day. I enjoy
              learning and I am always browsing the web looking for new
              technologies that could make me a stronger developer.
              <br />
              <br />
              My problem solving skills are something that I am really proud of,
              and have allowed me to make many exciting projects. Coding things
              like a calculator, a todo list, or a tic-tac-toe game seemed like
              they would be simple, but they really put my problem solving
              skills to the test! Fortunately, I have been able to develop those
              skills not only through learning how to code, but also through 4+
              years training martial arts. I have always found it extremely
              helpful to break down a big problem into smaller ones, and go from
              there. The one thing I really want to drive home about me is that
              I am a driven and hardworking individual, and I am committed to
              delivering exceptional results in everything I do. I would love to
              bring my skills and passion for web development to your team.

              This is my latest project and I am really proud of it! It is an
              e-commerce shopping cart built from scratch using React. This
              project allowed me to build a dynamic shopping cart and
              user-friendly interface that lets the user interact with data from
              an API seamlessly. The cart is very easy to use. Once a user adds
              items to their cart, they can view those items, as well as remove
              those items with the click of a button.

              This is an admin dashboard that displays the user's current
              projects and much more. I used Sass for this project in order to
              familiarize myself with it. This project really showcases that I
              can lay out elements on the page, and make them look great without
              using a CSS framework/library. The project cards were layed out
              using Grid, and a lot of the other elements were layed out using
              Flexbox! The focus of this project is more visual than functional,
              as opposed to the shopping cart.
